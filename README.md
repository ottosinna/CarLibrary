The Car Library application is designed to provide users with a comprehensive tool for managing their collection of cars. The primary purpose of this application is to allow users to store and manipulate a set of car data using a stack-like data structure. By offering a range of features and functionalities, the Car Library aims to simplify the process of organizing and maintaining a personal car inventory.

One of the key features of the Car Library is the ability to create and manage multiple car stacks. Users can create new stacks, each with a specified capacity, and select the stack they want to work with at any given time. This stack-based approach allows users to organize their cars in a logical and intuitive manner, mimicking the behavior of a physical stack of car keys or car documents.

The application also supports various operations on the car stacks, enabling users to add new cars, remove cars, and view the car at the top of the current stack. These car-related actions are essential for maintaining an up-to-date and accurate record of the user's car collection. The ability to search for cars by their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) further enhances the user's ability to quickly locate and manage specific cars within their collection.

In addition to the core stack management and car operation features, the Car Library application also offers persistence capabilities. Users can save the current state of a car stack to a file and later load that stack from the saved file. This feature allows users to preserve their car collection data, ensuring that their work is not lost and can be resumed at a later time. The potential future implementation of undo and redo functionality would further strengthen the application's ability to handle changes and modifications to the car stacks.

Overall, the Car Library application provides users with a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for managing their personal car collections. By offering a range of features, including stack management, car operations, and data persistence, the application aims to streamline the process of organizing and maintaining a diverse set of car-related information, ultimately enhancing the user's ability to keep track of their automotive assets.
